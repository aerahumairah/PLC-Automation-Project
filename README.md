# PLC-Automation-Project
During my internship, I had the chance to assist and learn about how PLC works alongside HMI as its output using ladder logic programming language. 

This project demonstrates a **PLC-based automation system** with **HMI integration**

---

## Features
- Ladder Logic programming for automation sequence.
- HMI interface for real-time monitoring and control.
- Prototype tested with physical hardware.

---

## Project Structure
- ladder_logic/ → PLC ladder diagrams
- hmi_design/ → HMI screenshots & design files
- report/ → Project explanation
- prototype/ → Photos of wiring & hardware setup

---

## Tools & Hardware
- Siemens PLC (or specify your model)  
- HMI Panel (or simulation software if used)  
- Electrical components (relay, push buttons, etc.)  

---

## How to Run
1. Open ladder diagram in your PLC software.
2. Load the program to PLC hardware (or run in simulation).  
3. Connect HMI panel (or run HMI design file).  

---

## Results
- Successful execution of ladder logic controlling
- HMI allows user-friendly operation.  
- Prototype tested with real hardware.  

---

## Media
Screenshots and prototype photos are available in the `prototype/` folder.
